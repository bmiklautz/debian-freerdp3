Description: Windows Portable Runtime library
 WinPR is a spin-off project of FreeRDP which aims at providing a portable
 implementation of important portions of the Windows API. Just like FreeRDP,
 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.

 This package contains the WinPR shared library.
